# Summary

In 2022 I graduated Medical University / Faculty of Pharmacy and realized that I need a different job, a job where I constantly need to think and my brain will work all 8 hours a day. Programming was perfect - I tried it, I liked it, so I started to study JavaScript in depth in order to become a mobile developer in the future.

Currently working as a Recruiter in an IT company.

# Skills

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Git, GitHub
- VS Code

# Code example

```
function myLanguages(results) {
let objectToArray = Object.entries(results)
let array = objectToArray.sort((a, b) => a[1] > b[1] ? -1 : 1)

let result = []
array.forEach(function(elem) {
if (elem[1] >= 60) {
result.push(elem[0])
}
})
return result
}
```
